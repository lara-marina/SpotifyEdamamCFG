# SpotifyEdamamCFG
CFG Kickstarter

This is my final project after the 8 week course offered by CFG covering foundations in Python and app development.

I created a search tool which utilises Spotify API/ Spotipy and Recipefy API to match genres to individual types of cuisine/ recipe. (pop -> desserts, techno -> cocktails)
